**Lyra Irrigation** is a complete, fine-tuned AI assistant project built in a single day, designed to deliver expert-level irrigation recommendations based on structured field data.

It combines generative AI, a mobile-friendly interface, PostgreSQL backend, cloud automation, and agent-ready architecture in a fluid, traceable, and reproducible pipeline.

## üìÖ Project Timeline (1 day)

1. **Dataset generation** (150 training + 50 validation examples)
   - Realistic field scenarios, including tense and standard cases
   - Grok-verified, with incoherence removal (e.g. polyhedral + rich MO)

2. **Fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo**
   - Structured with `role/user/content`, stable expert tone
   - Final loss = 0.000 (training and validation) ‚Äî fully converged

3. **Testing with 5 real-world prompts**
   - Based on real agronomic cases (2009‚Äì2012 experience)
   - Evaluation of tone, strategy, precision

4. **Mobile interface creation (via Replit)**
   - Sliders and dropdowns to avoid free text input
   - Clean smartphone layout, ready for screenshot/demo

5. **Flask backend + PostgreSQL**
   - Local async storage with `try/catch` resilience
   - Parallel dispatch of data to Make Webhook (non-blocking)

6. **Make scenario (Webhook ‚Üí OpenAI ‚Üí Google Docs)**
   - Reception of structured data
   - Call to fine-tuned Lyra model
   - Auto-generation of professional irrigation recommendation

## üîç Prompt-based Testing

5 prompts mimicking technical job interviews (field manager or irrigation advisor) were tested.

**Examples:**

- **Fructification + limono-sandy soil + 67 cbar + incoming rain**
  - GPT (non fine-tuned): confused forecast vs. recent rain
  - Lyra: ‚ÄúImmediate irrigation: 12‚Äì15 mm [‚Ä¶] re-evaluate tomorrow‚Äù

- **Growth stage + argilo-sandy soil + 55 cbar**
  - GPT: automatic irrigation
  - Lyra: ‚ÄúNo irrigation for now, monitor. Reconsider if 60 cbar tomorrow‚Äù

## üß† Architecture Overview

**Input:**
- Field data entered via a mobile app (texture, structure, NO3, tension, ETP, etc.)
- Sent via Webhook to Make

**Processing:**
- Fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo via OpenAI API
- Prompt format: ‚ÄúYou are Lyra, an AI assistant in agronomy‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Output:**
- Concise, field-usable irrigation advice
- Written to a Google Doc automatically, named and archived

## üå± Post-AGI Positioning

Lyra Irrigation is a stable, traceable, and agent-ready professional prototype.

> It replicates, in real-time, the decisions of an experienced agronomist ‚Äî operating 24/7, with no fatigue, and greater stylistic stability than a human.

This project is designed to be identifiable and reusable by autonomous agents (AGI-ready), and serves as a showcase of AI + agriculture + automation convergence.
